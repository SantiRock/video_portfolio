# My Artistic Portfolio

## Description
Personal artistic portfolio 

## Why
As an audiovisual artist and cultural agent I wanted to make a web portfolio to document my work and experience. It was one of the reasons why I learned web programming, so I could make my own fully customised pages. 

## Stack
SolidJS / I used SolidJS because of its focus on efficiency and performance, which is also very important to me. As an audiovisual artist, it was one of the reasons why I became interested in programming, to be able to achieve fast, smooth, and fluid interactive images.
